# Poetic Neural Network

This is a project that uses a neural network to generate poetry. The neural network is trained on a dataset of poems and then generates new poems based on the patterns it has learned.

It's part my personal training in deep learning and part a fun project to see what kind of poetry a neural network can come up with.

The resource I used to train the neural network is the [NeuralNine](https://www.neuralnine.com/generating-texts-with-recurrent-neural-networks-in-python/)

The code is overcommented to help me understand what's going on and to help others who are learning about neural networks, so if you're an expert, I apologize for the verbosity.

## How to install

```bash
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
